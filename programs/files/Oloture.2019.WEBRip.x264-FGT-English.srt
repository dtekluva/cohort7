527
00:47:06,865 --> 00:47:12,704
Girl, listen,
anything important people do to you,

528
00:47:12,788 --> 00:47:15,165
just take it as experience.

529
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:22,381
Learn from the event and let it go.
There is nothing you can do about it.

530
00:47:31,473 --> 00:47:35,769
You see... if you were one of my girls,
I would have protected you.

531
00:47:35,852 --> 00:47:37,187
Excuse me.

532
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:39,356
The way you protect Blessing, right?

533
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:49,825
In this, our game,
it's all connected to the Mafia.

534
00:47:51,243 --> 00:47:54,830
My connections are the real Mafia.

535
00:47:55,872 --> 00:47:57,833
In fact,
they are the pioneers of this game.

536
00:47:59,084 --> 00:48:03,046
So if I fuck up, they will kill me.

537
00:48:04,923 --> 00:48:09,553
If you fuck up, I will have to kill you.

538
00:48:14,808 --> 00:48:17,686
-Tony--
-Just let me finish.

539
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:23,650
If you tell me you have 15 girls

540
00:48:24,443 --> 00:48:27,237
and I let them know
I'm sending 15 girls...

541
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:30,324
then it has to be 15 girls.

542
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:39,458
Alero, 15 has to be 15.

543
00:48:41,501 --> 00:48:42,836
Not 14.

544
00:48:42,919 --> 00:48:45,339
-I have 15 girls.
-Mm-hmm.

545
00:48:47,549 --> 00:48:51,637
Because I heard
that one of your girls left.

546
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:55,140
Yes, but I have replaced her.

547
00:48:55,974 --> 00:48:59,019
Hmm. Let me see her.

548
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:25,003
[laughing]

549
00:49:25,712 --> 00:49:28,590
This one is forze speciali.

550
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:35,097
But she looks like trouble.

551
00:49:37,432 --> 00:49:41,269
I've yet to meet a beautiful woman
who's not trouble.

552
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:44,648
[chuckles]

553
00:49:47,442 --> 00:49:48,610
Has she paid?

554
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:51,363
She will pay.

555
00:49:52,364 --> 00:49:53,824
Are you sure?

556
00:49:55,742 --> 00:49:56,743
Hmm?

557
00:49:57,244 --> 00:50:00,205
Because it has to be 15 girls.

558
00:50:01,707 --> 00:50:03,709
Fifteen has to be 15.

559
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:07,963
I'm sure she will pay.

560
00:50:09,381 --> 00:50:10,882
Okay.

561
00:50:23,645 --> 00:50:25,647
[cell phone ringing]

562
00:50:33,113 --> 00:50:36,450
[in Edo]
Good afternoon, Mother. It's me, Linda.

563
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:40,162
My dear! How is everything in the city?

564
00:50:40,245 --> 00:50:42,164
Everything is fine over here.

565
00:50:42,247 --> 00:50:44,499
Things are falling into place
for me and Beauty.

566
00:50:45,584 --> 00:50:49,588
That is good news. Thank you
very much for doing this for us...

567
00:50:49,671 --> 00:50:51,673
-Not to worry.
-...for our family.

568
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:55,343
I will continue to pray
for you and your sister.

569
00:50:55,427 --> 00:50:58,305
Thank you. Is Beauty there with you?

570
00:50:58,388 --> 00:51:00,182
-Yes, she is.
-I would like to speak with her.

571
00:51:00,265 --> 00:51:02,142
-Hey, Beauty!
-[Beauty] Yes, Mother?

572
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:05,729
Come, your sister wants to speak with you.

573
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:10,442
-Yes, Mother?
-It's your sister.

574
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:14,196
[in Pidgin] Hello? Linda, how are you?

575
00:51:14,279 --> 00:51:18,825
What's up, Beauty?
Get ready. It's time to come to Lagos.

576
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:21,828
Okay, I will. I will.

577
00:51:31,588 --> 00:51:33,799
[hip-hop music playing]

578
00:51:33,882 --> 00:51:36,510
I called my sister and told her
I have made all our payments.

579
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:38,094
[laughs]

580
00:51:38,178 --> 00:51:40,138
She is so happy.

581
00:51:43,016 --> 00:51:46,311
She was just screaming, "Europe! Europe!"

582
00:51:46,394 --> 00:51:48,605
-[laughing]
-[horn honking]

583
00:51:49,856 --> 00:51:51,858
Do you still want to go to Europe?

584
00:51:52,651 --> 00:51:56,196
I'm not sure.
It's a really expensive trip.

585
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:57,614
[Linda] Yeah, it is.

586
00:51:57,697 --> 00:51:59,533
Which one of you is Ehi?

587
00:52:00,826 --> 00:52:02,244
That's her.

588
00:52:03,453 --> 00:52:05,413
Some guy over there is looking for you.

589
00:52:06,998 --> 00:52:08,250
Very handsome.

590
00:52:11,336 --> 00:52:14,005
Mmm!

591
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:31,147
Mister, what's up?

592
00:52:31,857 --> 00:52:35,735
[in English] Cut the bullshit.
Why haven't you been answering my calls?

593
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:39,072
[in Pidgin] Do you want a hand job,
blow job or full fuck?

594
00:52:39,155 --> 00:52:41,074
Just enter the car.

595
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:47,581
Please.

596
00:52:49,457 --> 00:52:50,709
Please.

597
00:53:15,233 --> 00:53:16,610
What is going on?

598
00:53:22,532 --> 00:53:24,826
Are you going to say something or not?

599
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:27,370
Only if you calm down.

600
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:30,040
I really can't deal with
any more shouting right now.

601
00:53:30,123 --> 00:53:31,458
Okay.

602
00:53:33,418 --> 00:53:34,628
Oloture.

603
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:36,922
What happened?

604
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:39,174
Nothing.

605
00:53:41,593 --> 00:53:43,553
Did something happen at the party?

606
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:46,765
No.

607
00:53:46,848 --> 00:53:48,850
Then why are you acting strange?

608
00:53:48,934 --> 00:53:50,727
Because I am tired.

609
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:56,024
Staying awake all day and most
of the night has that effect on me.

610
00:54:17,045 --> 00:54:18,421
How was the party?

611
00:54:20,131 --> 00:54:21,549
Just a party.

612
00:54:23,176 --> 00:54:26,638
Rich people doing what they love to do.

613
00:54:49,577 --> 00:54:52,747
It's over. I need you back at work.

614
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:59,671
I met the trafficker.
And she has agreed to take me to Europe.

615
00:54:59,754 --> 00:55:01,881
Well, that's...

616
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:04,718
That's great!
That's what we wanted, right?

617
00:55:07,178 --> 00:55:09,264
This story is not finished.

618
00:55:09,347 --> 00:55:11,975
What are you talking about?

619
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:16,855
I am saying that there is so much more
to this story that needs to be told,

620
00:55:16,938 --> 00:55:20,400
so many people
that need to be brought down.

621
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:22,444
Okay, that's it.

622
00:55:22,527 --> 00:55:25,113
I don't know where this is coming from.
I don't know what it is.

623
00:55:25,196 --> 00:55:28,491
But it's not up for conversation anymore.
You're off the story.

624
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:32,328
Look, Emeka, this is no longer your story.

625
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:35,248
It is now my story.

626
00:55:35,331 --> 00:55:38,460
And I will get to the end of it
with or without you.

627
00:55:50,388 --> 00:55:51,556
Auntie Alero.

628
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:53,933
Good afternoon.

629
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:56,770
-Do I know you?
-My name is Blessing.

630
00:55:56,853 --> 00:56:00,106
I stay at Sandra's house
with Ehi and Linda.

631
00:56:01,066 --> 00:56:03,568
Oh, you're Chuks's girl, right?

632
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:07,781
-Yes, I am.
-What do you want from me?

633
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:11,034
-I want to go to the next level.
-No, Blessing! No, no, no.

634
00:56:11,117 --> 00:56:14,245
I have saved up, like, $200.
I will make more soon.

635
00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:15,872
Blessing! No!

636
00:56:15,955 --> 00:56:20,835
Please, I just want
to elevate myself a little. Please!

637
00:56:20,919 --> 00:56:23,046
I don't deal with girls that have pimps.

638
00:56:23,129 --> 00:56:26,674
And you know Chuks is a lunatic,
so I can't help you.

639
00:56:40,522 --> 00:56:41,648
[Alero] Uh-huh.

640
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:51,741
Don't mind that local puttana.

641
00:56:54,702 --> 00:56:55,870
Oh...

642
00:56:57,956 --> 00:57:00,583
Does that motherfucker want
to mess around with me?

643
00:57:01,626 --> 00:57:02,710
[scoffs]

644
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:10,927
I will show that bitch
who she is dealing with.

645
00:57:16,558 --> 00:57:17,809
Okay, tomorrow.

646
00:57:31,364 --> 00:57:32,532
We are leaving tomorrow.

647
00:57:49,799 --> 00:57:51,217
Sorry I took so long.

648
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:56,514
-Where did you go?
-I went to the market.

649
00:57:56,598 --> 00:57:59,684
I'm sorry for coming late.

650
00:58:05,106 --> 00:58:06,399
Chuks, is something wrong?

651
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:10,570
You know...

652
00:58:12,572 --> 00:58:16,743
I really thought you and I
were really getting on well.

653
00:58:21,414 --> 00:58:23,291
-But we are.
-[grunts]

654
00:58:24,125 --> 00:58:26,085
I'm sure we are getting on well.

655
00:58:27,545 --> 00:58:29,047
[scoffs]

656
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:32,175
-You're sure?
-I'm sure.

657
00:58:33,259 --> 00:58:34,552
I'm sure.

658
00:58:34,636 --> 00:58:36,095
Are you truly sure?

659
00:58:37,388 --> 00:58:41,434
Yes! Why are you asking me
these sorts of questions?

660
00:58:44,646 --> 00:58:47,774
Because if we were getting on well,

661
00:58:48,691 --> 00:58:54,030
you wouldn't go and see Alero
about going to Europe.

662
00:58:55,573 --> 00:58:56,699
Chuks, I'm sorry...

663
00:58:58,076 --> 00:58:59,494
[crying]

664
00:58:59,577 --> 00:59:02,539
No worries, no worries.

665
00:59:02,622 --> 00:59:08,294
I'll make sure you won't try it again.

666
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:10,922
-Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!
-[whimpering]

667
00:59:11,005 --> 00:59:13,132
Take off this stupid wig.

668
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:15,176
Very stupid!

669
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:18,346
[sobbing]

670
00:59:45,123 --> 00:59:47,667
-Beauty!
-Linda!

671
00:59:57,218 --> 01:00:00,513
Where is your bag? Come and show it to me.

672
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:01,723
Which one?

673
01:00:06,185 --> 01:00:09,981
Look at you! You are now a big girl.

674
01:00:10,064 --> 01:00:13,109
-How is Mum?
-She's fine.

675
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:16,529
Please.

676
01:00:19,282 --> 01:00:20,533
Come back to me.

677
01:00:22,577 --> 01:00:23,661
I will.

678
01:00:25,288 --> 01:00:26,414
Um...

679
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:33,046
I want you to keep this for me.

680
01:00:33,796 --> 01:00:35,214
What's this?

681
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:40,261
It's my report of everything that
has happened while I've been in the house.

682
01:00:47,894 --> 01:00:48,978
Um...

683
01:00:50,229 --> 01:00:51,606
I should get going.

684
01:01:06,954 --> 01:01:08,373
Quick, quick, quick.

685
01:01:10,291 --> 01:01:12,585
Auntie Alero,
this is my sister I told you about.

686
01:01:12,669 --> 01:01:14,879
Get on the bus. Quick, quick, quick.

687
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:23,137
Get on the bus. Quick, quick, quick.

688
01:01:23,971 --> 01:01:25,014
[man] Move.

689
01:01:44,283 --> 01:01:49,330
Wait, wait. I don't understand.
He was so good at school.

690
01:01:49,414 --> 01:01:51,290
There was no money for him to keep going.

691
01:01:51,374 --> 01:01:54,419
No money? What did you do
with all the money I sent home?

692
01:01:54,502 --> 01:01:59,132
Sister, we used that for food.
After that, there was nothing left.

693
01:02:06,139 --> 01:02:07,473
Don't worry.

694
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:13,813
As soon as we get to Europe,
we will send more money home. Okay?

695
01:02:15,064 --> 01:02:16,274
Come.

696
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:26,325
[Oloture's voice]
Chuks is an old-fashioned pimp

697
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:29,704
who is fast becoming redundant
in the modern world.

698
01:02:29,787 --> 01:02:32,957
Years ago, he would have had many girls,

699
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:35,126
but times have changed with the Internet,

700
01:02:35,209 --> 01:02:39,464
and apps like Lovers Zone
have replaced men like him.

701
01:02:39,547 --> 01:02:42,091
But desperation creates danger,

702
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:45,595
and Chuks prowls the pavements
like a hungry bear.

703
01:02:46,763 --> 01:02:49,056
Blessing is Chuks's last girl.

704
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:54,520
She is an orphan and was abused
by the state since she was a kid.

705
01:02:54,604 --> 01:02:57,190
Broken, bruised and battered,

706
01:02:57,273 --> 01:03:00,109
Blessing cannot escape Chuks's grasp.

707
01:03:00,193 --> 01:03:02,987
He has too much power over her,

708
01:03:03,070 --> 01:03:05,490
and she has nowhere else to go.

709
01:03:05,573 --> 01:03:11,037
And the two of them seem to be
on an inexorable slow train to disaster.

710
01:03:30,598 --> 01:03:32,850
Hurry up, hurry up!

711
01:03:32,934 --> 01:03:37,688
All of you, out of the bus now!

712
01:03:37,772 --> 01:03:40,566
-Bring down your bags.
-[man 2] Come down, come down.

713
01:03:41,692 --> 01:03:43,903
[man] Stop wasting my time!

714
01:03:43,986 --> 01:03:45,321
[man 2] Are you deaf?

715
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:49,116
Everybody, bring down your bags!

716
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:51,244
Bring down your bags! Line up!

717
01:03:51,327 --> 01:03:53,204
[man 2] Line up, line up, line up.

718
01:03:53,287 --> 01:03:55,873
[man 1] Take your bags down there
to be searched.

719
01:03:55,957 --> 01:03:59,460
[man 2] Move! Fast! Open up, open up.

720
01:03:59,544 --> 01:04:01,337
All phones here. Put your phones here.

721
01:04:01,420 --> 01:04:03,756
Wait, open them. All right, go.

722
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:05,883
Open your bag.

723
01:04:05,967 --> 01:04:10,179
-From now till you get to Europe...
-[man 2] Why are you shaking?

724
01:04:10,263 --> 01:04:14,016
...no more communication
with anybody outside.

725
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:16,060
-Move! You, move!
-[woman shrieks]

726
01:04:18,229 --> 01:04:20,523
-Where is your phone?
-I don't have a phone.

727
01:04:21,107 --> 01:04:24,193
-Why are you lying?
-I don't have a phone, really.

728
01:04:31,158 --> 01:04:32,493
Want me to be ruthless with you?

729
01:04:32,577 --> 01:04:33,786
-No, sir.
-Where is your phone?

730
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:35,872
-I don't have a phone.
-[man 2] Open it!

731
01:04:38,249 --> 01:04:40,293
[man 1] Now that you are here,

732
01:04:41,168 --> 01:04:44,463
I don't want to hear a word
from any of you.

733
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:47,466
-I want total silence.
-Move. Move!

734
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:50,011
We are in control of everything over here.

735
01:04:50,094 --> 01:04:51,637
Am I making myself clear?

736
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:54,181
-I said, am I making myself clear?
-[women] Yes, sir!

737
01:04:59,437 --> 01:05:00,479
A.

738
01:05:02,690 --> 01:05:03,691
B.

739
01:05:07,653 --> 01:05:08,654
C.

740
01:05:09,989 --> 01:05:10,990
C.

741
01:05:15,244 --> 01:05:16,245
B.

742
01:05:18,164 --> 01:05:19,957
Hey! Come.

743
01:05:21,125 --> 01:05:22,293
A.

744
01:05:26,672 --> 01:05:27,673
A.

745
01:05:32,511 --> 01:05:33,596
[grunts]

746
01:05:35,222 --> 01:05:36,265
B.

747
01:05:39,101 --> 01:05:40,561
Hey!

748
01:05:42,813 --> 01:05:43,898
A.

749
01:05:43,981 --> 01:05:48,277
-She is my sister.
-What did I say before?

750
01:05:51,072 --> 01:05:53,491
You better keep your mouth shut.

751
01:05:54,158 --> 01:05:56,869
I don't care who she is.

752
01:05:56,953 --> 01:05:58,579
Do you hear me?

753
01:06:01,624 --> 01:06:02,750
B!

754
01:06:04,293 --> 01:06:05,294
A!

755
01:06:17,348 --> 01:06:18,349
A.

756
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:43,708
[Oloture's voice] The last thing
I remembered, he was on top of me,

757
01:06:43,791 --> 01:06:46,669
his breath sour in my face.

758
01:06:47,628 --> 01:06:54,427
I tried to fight him off, but my body was
not working anymore because of the drugs.

759
01:06:55,553 --> 01:07:00,683
The doctor confirmed the next day
that I had been brutally raped.

760
01:07:02,935 --> 01:07:04,770
There was no condom involved.

761
01:07:05,354 --> 01:07:10,526
This is a well-known man, a politician.

762
01:07:10,609 --> 01:07:13,237
His name is Sir Phillip Ondaje.

763
01:07:14,238 --> 01:07:19,660
This is what he does for fun.
He drugs women and then rapes them.

764
01:07:30,546 --> 01:07:32,757
[Oloture's voice, in Pidgin]
You've reached the voice mail of Ehi.

765
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:35,676
Please leave your message after the tone.

766
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:36,844
Thank you.

767
01:07:37,636 --> 01:07:39,930
Oh, my goodness, Oloture.
Where are you? Where are you?

768
01:07:41,724 --> 01:07:44,685
You need to come in.
You need to come in immediately.

769
01:07:46,771 --> 01:07:48,898
And please call me once you get this.

770
01:07:55,529 --> 01:07:57,990
What's with all these groups we're in?

771
01:07:59,033 --> 01:08:00,576
I have no idea.

772
01:08:02,286 --> 01:08:05,206
I don't like not being
in the same group as my sister.

773
01:08:06,707 --> 01:08:08,250
It'll be okay.

774
01:08:08,876 --> 01:08:10,419
-Huh?
-Yes.

775
01:08:10,503 --> 01:08:11,796
You don't understand.

776
01:08:11,879 --> 01:08:17,635
She is not street smart like me.
I have to protect her.

777
01:08:24,350 --> 01:08:27,353
See, she's a virgin.

778
01:08:27,436 --> 01:08:29,814
-Huh?
-Yes.

779
01:08:29,897 --> 01:08:32,858
That's why Auntie Alero
agreed to take her.

780
01:08:44,245 --> 01:08:48,457
Auntie, there is some guy here.
He's looking for Ehi.

781
01:08:55,005 --> 01:08:59,844
Sir, Ehi and Linda are not here.
They left today.

782
01:08:59,927 --> 01:09:01,428
Please, do you know where they went?

783
01:09:01,512 --> 01:09:03,848
I have no idea where she is.
They left without warning.

784
01:09:03,931 --> 01:09:06,016
So now I've got to find two new people.

785
01:09:06,851 --> 01:09:10,104
-So, you don't even know--
-I said I don't know anything.

786
01:09:10,187 --> 01:09:12,022
Ask the other girls.

787
01:09:25,619 --> 01:09:27,746
[no audible dialogue]

788
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:44,513
Customer, you want to have some fun?

789
01:09:44,597 --> 01:09:47,933
Sister, please, I'm looking for Ehi.

790
01:09:49,435 --> 01:09:53,314
Even when the bitch is not here,
she's still ruining business for me.

791
01:09:53,397 --> 01:09:57,067
-[sucks teeth] Please fuck off.
-Please, do you know where she might be?

792
01:09:58,277 --> 01:10:02,072
You're not going to find her.
They have all left for Italy.

793
01:10:02,156 --> 01:10:06,202
-What time did they leave?
-They left this afternoon.

794
01:10:08,621 --> 01:10:10,164
[laughs]

795
01:10:10,247 --> 01:10:13,626
Customer,
did you fall in love with a whore?

796
01:10:16,337 --> 01:10:20,090
I know your type, pretty boy.
You fall in love easily.

797
01:10:23,969 --> 01:10:28,974
Follow me inside. Rest assured,
I'll help you forget Ehi real quick.

798
01:10:29,850 --> 01:10:31,101
Thank you.

799
01:10:32,311 --> 01:10:35,022
Are you seriously rejecting me?
"Thank you"?

800
01:10:35,105 --> 01:10:38,108
You like them cheap, is that it?
That's why you're looking for Ehi.

801
01:11:38,085 --> 01:11:40,254
[buzzes]

802
01:11:44,550 --> 01:11:45,676
Hi.

803
01:11:45,759 --> 01:11:47,761
[Oloture, whispering]
I know you read the stuff,

804
01:11:47,845 --> 01:11:49,513
but I can't talk right now.

805
01:11:49,596 --> 01:11:52,057
-Just listen to me carefully.
-Okay.

806
01:11:52,141 --> 01:11:54,977
I am one hour northwest away from Lagos.

807
01:11:55,060 --> 01:12:00,482
My last turn was Agbara. My sense is we're
going to be here for the next few days.

808
01:12:00,566 --> 01:12:04,695
Hey, listen. We will come and get you.

809
01:12:06,613 --> 01:12:08,824
Okay, but I have to go now.

810
01:12:08,907 --> 01:12:10,200
I love you.

811
01:12:11,452 --> 01:12:14,455
I have to go. Bye.

812
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:11,887
Posture is very important in Europe.

813
01:13:13,347 --> 01:13:17,142
You need to stand straight.
See how I stand?

814
01:13:18,727 --> 01:13:24,983
Make sure all your God-given assets
are not hidden.

815
01:13:25,067 --> 01:13:26,402
You want them on display.

816
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:31,240
You, let me see your stomach.
Open. Let me see.

817
01:13:31,740 --> 01:13:33,075
Uh-huh.

818
01:13:33,158 --> 01:13:38,163
All your tette and your culo
must be on display.

819
01:13:38,789 --> 01:13:41,208
This is how you will earn
loads of money in Europe.

820
01:13:41,291 --> 01:13:42,543
[all] Yes, ma.

821
01:13:42,626 --> 01:13:44,128
Take a good look at her.

822
01:13:44,211 --> 01:13:48,090
She is what we call forze speciali.

823
01:13:48,173 --> 01:13:54,888
And if you want to become forze speciali,
its time to learn.

824
01:13:55,806 --> 01:13:57,349
-Do you understand?
-Yes, ma.

825
01:13:58,142 --> 01:14:00,436
You, walk for us.

826
01:14:03,689 --> 01:14:09,778
Shake them. They're your God-given assets.
With them, you'll make your money.

827
01:14:09,862 --> 01:14:12,573
Can you see her? Take a good look at her.

828
01:14:12,656 --> 01:14:16,076
Come back. You, you're next.

829
01:14:17,453 --> 01:14:21,540
Okay, this one's an expert.
Nothing to teach there.

830
01:14:21,623 --> 01:14:22,916
You come over here.

831
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:26,044
Hey! Look here.
You, the one who looked down!

832
01:14:28,213 --> 01:14:29,256
Come over here.

833
01:14:30,674 --> 01:14:32,092
Can you lap dance?

834
01:14:33,886 --> 01:14:37,514
Don't look so worried. It's no big deal.

835
01:14:37,598 --> 01:14:43,061
Just make sure
your pussy touches his dick.

836
01:14:43,145 --> 01:14:46,315
I'm not going to repeat myself!
So, show me what you can do.

837
01:14:46,398 --> 01:14:47,774
Bring your ass here.

838
01:14:50,944 --> 01:14:53,447
As attractive as she is,
why is she behaving like this?

839
01:14:53,530 --> 01:14:54,781
Move your ass sideways.

840
01:14:56,867 --> 01:15:01,330
-Sheriff, can you feel her pussy?
-I can't feel shit.

841
01:15:01,413 --> 01:15:03,457
Will you do it properly!

842
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:06,293
Sheriff, show her how to do it.

843
01:15:06,376 --> 01:15:09,213
-Grind!
-[sobbing]

844
01:15:09,838 --> 01:15:15,552
-Let her feel your dick.
-She is highly satisfying.

845
01:15:15,636 --> 01:15:18,722
Okay, step aside.

846
01:15:18,805 --> 01:15:21,308
All right, babe, step aside.

847
01:15:21,391 --> 01:15:27,022
You! Hey! Come over here.

848
01:15:27,856 --> 01:15:29,233
Why are you frowning?

849
01:15:34,363 --> 01:15:36,949
-Why are you in a hurry?
-This one looks like an expert.

850
01:15:37,032 --> 01:15:39,368
-Yes, she does know. I can feel it.
-She is a professional.

851
01:15:40,202 --> 01:15:42,120
Go gently.

852
01:15:45,082 --> 01:15:47,918
Sheriff, hold her waist.

853
01:15:48,001 --> 01:15:50,963
She's so good, in fact, I'm confused.

854
01:15:51,046 --> 01:15:53,423
That's enough. Step aside.

855
01:15:53,507 --> 01:15:55,175
Get up. You're too emotional.

856
01:15:56,552 --> 01:15:57,970
That one did too much.

857
01:16:01,139 --> 01:16:05,227
[Victor]
Now, where is that girl with the big ass?

858
01:16:05,310 --> 01:16:07,854
This is an emergency.

859
01:16:07,938 --> 01:16:09,815
I have one of my staff members in there.

860
01:16:09,898 --> 01:16:13,193
She's a journalist
with more bravery than sense.

861
01:16:13,277 --> 01:16:15,028
I need to get her out.

862
01:16:15,112 --> 01:16:17,155
I hear you, Mr. Okoye.

863
01:16:18,073 --> 01:16:20,742
All my men are out there
on special operations today.

864
01:16:21,326 --> 01:16:22,494
It's not possible.

865
01:16:27,249 --> 01:16:29,710
When is the earliest you're able to go?

866
01:16:32,337 --> 01:16:33,839
Well, um...

867
01:16:34,631 --> 01:16:38,969
if everything in your story
checks out, um,

868
01:16:39,052 --> 01:16:44,558
the absolute earliest would be
dawn tomorrow morning.

869
01:17:57,339 --> 01:18:00,467
[no audible dialogue]

870
01:18:40,257 --> 01:18:44,261
[chanting in African language]

871
01:18:48,014 --> 01:18:50,100
[laughing]

872
01:18:50,726 --> 01:18:53,353

I just want to call my mum quickly.

923
01:25:04,432 --> 01:25:06,559
I didn't know we wouldn't be able
to have our phones.

924
01:25:06,643 --> 01:25:08,853
No. No.

925
01:25:08,937 --> 01:25:11,439
I just want her to know
that Beauty and I are okay.

How is Beauty? I hope she's okay.

941
01:27:03,301 --> 01:27:05,970
Beauty is fine. I can't talk now.

942
01:27:07,305 --> 01:27:08,932
I will let you know when I can talk.

Give me that phone!

What did I say!

952
01:27:47,762 --> 01:27:50,139
I said no phones.

953
01:27:51,182 --> 01:27:55,895
I said anyone caught with a phone
would be dealt with.

954
01:27:58,856 --> 01:28:04,153
Not only does she have a phone,
she has been spying on us.

955
01:28:04,237 --> 01:28:05,697

Why did you have to kill her?

967
01:29:12,055 --> 01:29:14,640
She was sending information
about our operations. Who is she?

968
01:29:14,724 --> 01:29:16,601
What if she is from the police?

If not, it's your head.

-Do you know where her family lives?
-Of course I know.

974
01:29:40,625 --> 01:29:44,587
We need to send them a strong message
so they know who they're messing with.

What do you know about the phone?

01:31:42,914 --> 01:31:47,418
This one's a bush girl. Get her out
of my face. She doesn't know anything.

Well, it looks like they got away
before we got here.

1004
01:34:37,338 --> 01:34:39,757
They must have been tipped off.
They left in a hurry.

Where will they go now?
